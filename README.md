## Purpose

The purpose of this program is to practice and get back into Python programming, while simulatenously thinking about making a program from scratch. I will be creating a simple card to then build out upon later.

## Languages, Frameworks, Technology

While utilizing Python, a Framework that I am implementing is Pygame to help build a visual display. I want to also test and practice containerizing so utilizing Docker to do so.
